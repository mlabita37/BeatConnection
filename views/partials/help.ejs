      1. Enter a new drum pattern by clicking the white squares.
      The squares will turn green to indicate they are now part of the sequence. To remove a square from the sequence,
      simply click it again. You can remove the whole sequence by clicking "Clear".
      Use the "All" buttons to select every square (Hint: this can be useful for things like the HiHat).

      If you're not sure what those are, don't worry, just click each one and see which meter you prefer!
